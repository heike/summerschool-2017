Focus on writing, rather than debugging silly errors (I'm looking at you *LaTeX*).\n- It's **flexible**. Markdown was created to simplify writing HTML, but thanks to [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), Markdown converts to many different formats!\n- It's **dynamic**. Find a critical error? Get a new dataset? Regenerate your report without copy/paste hell!\n- Encourages **transparency**. Collaborators (including your future self) will thank you for integrating your analysis & report.\n- Enables **interactivity/reactivity**. Allow your audience to explore the analysis (rather than passively read it).\n\n## First things first, *what* is Markdown?\n\n- Markdown is a particular type of markup language.\n- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from plain text.\n- Some of you may be familiar with *LaTeX*. This is another (less human friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.\n- *LaTeX* gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a **much** greater learning curve.\n- Markdown is becoming a standard. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit).\n\n## *Who* is using R Markdown, and *for what*?\n\n* The [R Markdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is built with R Markdown.\n* The [new edition of the ggplot2 book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/) uses it.\n* R package vignettes (for example, [I made this for plotly](http://cpsievert.github.io/plotly/pipe-dsl/)).\n* [Many](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/index.html) great [tutorials](http://renkun.me/learnR/) use R markdown add-ons such as [Rgitbook](http://jason.bryer.org/Rgitbook/).\n* People are blogging with it.\n\n## What is *R* Markdown?\n\n* Straight from the [R Markdown home page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/):\n\n> R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of **markdown** (an easy-to-write plain text format) **with embedded R code chunks** that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\nStudy the first page of the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf). \n\nYes, the *entire* markdown syntax can be described in one page!\n\nCan you think of anything that is missing from the syntax (that you might want when creating documents)?\n\n## Markdown doesn't natively support...\n\n- unfortunately quite a lot ... :\n    * Figure/table referencing (Well, sort of... you can use it for pdfs)\n    * ~~Table of contents~~ (Support added recently!)\n- Many, many appearance related things (image/figure alignment, coloring, font families, etc.) \n\n## There is hope...\n\n- You don't *have to* restrict yourself to markdown. You can always include HTML/`LaTeX` markup, but don't expect it to convert between output formats.\n- There are many efforts to extend Markdown (but, then again, keeping it simple is the point!)\n- More features are being added almost daily\n- Templates are being created\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\nHave a look at R Markdown presentations and templates.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/pres.png\" width=600 height=300>\n</div>\n\n**Pro tip**: run `devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/rticles\")` to get more templates\n\n## Yaml Front Matter\n\nThe stuff at the top of the .Rmd file (called yaml front matter) tells **rmarkdown** what output format you want. \n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\ndate: \"June 21, 2016\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n```\n\nIn this case, when you click \"Knit HTML\", RStudio calls `rmarkdown::render(\"file.Rmd\", html_document())`. You can certainly change these default values (see the [source of this presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/rwrks/gh-pages/summerschool/01-Introduction-to-R/knitr/5-rmarkdown.Rmd)).\n\n## What is a code chunk?\n\nA code chunk is a concept borrowed from the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package (which, in turn, was inspired by [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)). In .Rmd files, you can start/end a code chunk with three back-ticks.\n\n```{r chunk1, verbatim = TRUE}\n1 + 1\n```\n\nWant to run a command in another language?\n\n```{r chunk2, engine = 'python', verbatim = TRUE}\nprint \"a\" + \"b\"\n```\n\n## Code chunk options\n\nThere are a plethora of [chunk options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) in **knitr** (engine is one of them). Here are some that I typically use:\n\n* `echo`: Show the code?\n* `eval`: Run the code?\n* `message`: Relay messages?\n* `warning`: Relay warnings?\n* `fig.width` and `fig.height`: Change size of figure output.\n* `cache`: Save the output of this chunk (so we don't have to run it next time)?\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\nStudy the second page of the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) and go back to the Hello R Markdown example we created.\n\n**Easy**: Modify the figure sizing and alignment.\n\n**Medium**: Add a figure caption.\n\n**Hard**: Can you create an animation? (Hint: look at the `fig.show` chunk option -- you might need to the **animation** package for this)\n\n**Pro Tip**: Don't like the default chunk option value? Change it at the top of the document:\n\n```{r setup, verbatim = TRUE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Formatting R output\n\n```{r}\nm <- lm(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)\nsummary(m) # output isn't very attractive\n```\n\n---\n\n[pander](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/) is one great option.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(pander)\npander(m)\n```\n\n---\n\n```{r}\na <- anova(m)\na\n```\n\n---\n\n```{r}\npander(a)\n```\n\n## Pander knows about a lot of different methods!\n\n```{r}\nmethods(pander)\n```\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\n* Look through the list of pander methods. Can you apply any of the methods that we haven't discussed? We just saw `pander.lm` and `pander.anova`.\n",
