Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.\n</blockquote>\n\n## The RStudio IDE\n\n<div class=\"columns-2\">\n1.

It combines the core syntax of __markdown__ (an easy-to-write plain text format) __with embedded R code chunks__ that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).\n</blockquote>\n\n- RStudio's [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) gives a nice, concise overview of its capabilities.\n\n- RStudio's [reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) lists its options.\n\n## For your reference\n\n- [Download](knitr/0-getting-started.Rmd), save, and open the document which generates these slides in RStudio (you can do that with this R code):\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ncurl::curl_download(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/rwrks/gh-pages/summerschool/01-Introduction-to-R/knitr/0-getting-started.Rmd\",\n  \"0-getting-started.Rmd\"\n)\nfile.edit(\"0-getting-started.Rmd\")\n```\n\n- [Download](knitr/0-getting-started.R), save, and open the corresponding R script.\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ncurl::curl_download(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/rwrks/gh-pages/summerschool/01-Introduction-to-R/code/0-getting-started.R\",\n  \"0-getting-started.R\"\n)\nfile.edit(\"0-getting-started.R\")\n```\n\n## Error message?\n\nIf R is complaining about not having the package `curl`, run\n\n```{r, eval= FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"curl\")\n```\n\nand try again",
