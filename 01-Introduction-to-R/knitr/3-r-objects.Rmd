## Data Frames

- Data Frames are the work horse of R objects
- Structured by rows and columns and can be indexed
- Each column is a specified variable type
- Columns names can be used to index a variable
- Advice for naming variable applys to editing columns names
- Can be specified by grouping vectors of equal length as columns

- Follow along (copy & paste the code into the console):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
curl::curl_download(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/rwrks/gh-pages/summerschool/01-Introduction-to-R/code/3-r-objects.R",
  "3-r-objects.R"
)
file.edit("3-r-objects.R")
```

## Data Frame Indexing

- Elements indexed similar to a vector using `[` `]`
- `df[i,j]` will select the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column
- `df[ ,j]` will select the entire $j^{th}$ column and treat it as a vector
- `df[i ,]` will select the entire $i^{th}$ row and treat it as a vector
- Logical vectors can be used in place of i and j used to subset the row and columns

## Adding a new Variable to a Data Frame

- Create a new vector that is the same length as other columns
- Append new column to the data frame using the `$` operator
- The new data frame column will adopt the name of the vector


This is what we did before in the tips data set:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tips <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/summerschool/data/tips.csv")
```

```{r}
# create rate variable in the tips data set:
tips$rate <- tips$tip / tips$total_bill
```


## Data Frame Demo

Use Edgar Anderson's Iris Data:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

Select Species column (5th column):

```{r}
iris[,5]
```

## Demo (Continued)

Select Species column with the `$` operator:

```{r}
iris$Species
```

## Demo (Continued)

```{r}
iris$Species == "setosa"
```

## Demo (Continued)

```{r}
iris[iris$Species=="setosa", ]
```

## Creating our own Data Frame

Create our own data frame using `data.frame` function

```{r}
mydf <- data.frame(NUMS = 1:5, 
                   lets = letters[1:5],
                   vehicle = c("car", "boat", "car", "car", "boat"))
mydf
```

##

`expand.grid` allows to quickly create all combinations of levels
```{r}
dframe <- data.frame(expand.grid(
  reps = 1:3, Type = c("Control", "Treatment")))
dframe
```

## Renaming columns

The `names` function can be used on the left hand side and the right hand side of an assignment:

```{r}
names(dframe)

names(dframe)[1] <- "Reps"
dframe
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Make a data frame with column 1: 1,2,3,4,5,6 and column 2: a,b,a,b,a,b
2. Select only rows with value "a" in column 2 using a logical vector
3. `mtcars` is a built in data set like `iris`: Extract the 4th row of the `mtcars` data.

## Lists

- Lists are a structured collection of R objects
- R objects in a list need not be the same type
- Create lists using the `list` function
- Lists indexed using double square brackets `[[ ]]` to select an object

## List Example

Creating a list containing a vector and a matrix:

```{r}
mylist <- list(matrix(letters[1:10], nrow = 2, ncol = 5),
               seq(0, 49, by = 7))
mylist
```

Use indexing to select the second list element:

```{r}
mylist[[2]]
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Create a list containing a vector and a 2x3 data frame
2. Use indexing to select the data frame from your list
3. Use further indexing to select the first row from the data frame in your list

## Examining Objects

- `head(x)` - View top 6 rows of a data frame
- `tail(x)` - View bottom 6 rows of a data frame
- `summary(x)` - Summary statistics   
- `str(x)` - View structure of object  
- `dim(x)` - View dimensions of object 
- `length(x)` - Returns the length of a vector

## Examining Objects Example

We can examine the first two values of an object by passing the `n` parameter to the `head` function:

```{r}
head(iris, n = 2)
```

What's its structure?

```{r}
str(iris)
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. View the top 8 rows of mtcars data
2. What type of object is the mtcars data set?
3. How many rows are in the mtcars data set? (try finding this using dim or indexing + length)
4. Summarize the values in each column of the mtcars data set

## Working with Output from a Function

- Can save output from a function as an object
- Object is generally a list of output objects
- Can pull off items from the output for further computing
- Examine object using functions like `str(x)`

## Saving Output Demo

- `t-test` using iris data to see if petal lengths for setosa and versicolor are the same
- `t.test` function can only handle two groups, so we subset out the virginica species

```{r}
t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris[iris$Species != "virginica", ])
```

## Demo (Continued)

Save the output of the `t-test` function to an object

```{r}
tout <- t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris[iris$Species != "virginica", ])
```

Let's look at the structure of this object:

```{r}
str(tout)
```

## Demo: Extracting the P-Value

Since this is simply a list, we can use our regular indexing:

```{r}
tout$p.value
tout[[3]]
```

## Importing Data

We often need to import in our own data rather than just using built-in datasets.

- First need to tell R where the data is saved (either by specifying the path or navigating the working directory by setting `setwd()`)
- For finding a file/path can use a file browser/search by calling `file.choose()`
- Data read in using R functions such as:
    - `read.table()` for reading in .txt files
    - `read.csv()` for reading in .csv files
- Assign the data to new R object when reading in the file

```{r}
write.csv(iris, "iris.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
## Exporting Data and Objects

- Similarly to importing, exporting is supported using functions:

    - for data frames use `write.csv` or `write.table`
    - for more general objects such as lists use `save` (see `?save`). Objects saved with `save` can be loaded using the function `load()`
    - `save` writes the object in an rda format (short for R data) - this is a R specific binary format (it is small, keeps types and loads fast) 

```{r}
iris_rda <- iris
save(iris_rda, file="iris-data.rda")
rm(iris_rda) # object is gone from environment

load("iris-data.rda") # and now it is back!
```


## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

- Write the iris data set into a csv file on your machine. Check where it appears. For a challenge try to change the location. 
- Export the `tout` object using the function `save`. Delete `tout` from your working environment by running `rm(tout)`. 
Load the previously saved object using `load`. If everything went alright, `tout` will be back in your working environment!
