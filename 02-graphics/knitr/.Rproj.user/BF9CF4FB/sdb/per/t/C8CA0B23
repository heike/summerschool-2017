It contains the prices and attributes of over 50,000 diamonds\n\n## Examining the Diamonds Data\n\nWhat does the data look like?\n\nLets look at the top few rows of the diamond data frame to find out!\n\n```{r}\nhead(diamonds)\n```\n\n## Basic Scatterplot\n\nBasic scatter plot of diamond price vs carat weight\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(carat, price, geom = \"point\", data = diamonds)\n```\n\n## Another Scatterplot\n\nScatter plot of diamond price vs carat weight showing versitility of options in qplot\n\n```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}\nqplot(carat, log(price), geom = \"point\", data = diamonds, \n\talpha = I(0.2), colour = color, \n\tmain = \"Log price by carat weight, grouped by color\") + \n    xlab(\"Carat Weight\") + ylab(\"Log Price\")\n```\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\nAll of the your turns for this section will use the tips data set:\n\n```{r}\ntips <- read.csv(\"http://heike.github.io/rwrks/summerschool/data/tips.csv\")\n```\n\n1. Use qplot to build a scatterplot of variables tips and total bill\n2. Use options within qplot to color points by smokers\n3. Clean up axis labels and add main plot title\n\n## Basic Histogram\n\nBasic histogram of price\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(price, geom = \"histogram\", data = diamonds)\n```\n\n## Why setting the bin width is useful\n\nHistogram of price, binwidth is set to $50 \n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(price, geom = \"histogram\",  binwidth = 50, data = diamonds)\n```\n\nThe gap in prices at around $2000 is due to the scraping procedure.\n\n## Another Histogram\n\nPrice histograms faceted by clarity\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(price, geom = \"histogram\", data = diamonds, binwidth = 100, facets = .~clarity)\n```\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\n1. Create a new variable in tips data frame rate = tip / total bill\n2. Use qplot to create a histogram of rate\n3. Change the bin width on that histogram to 0.05\n4. Facet this histogram by size of the group\n\n## Basic Boxplot\n\nSide by side boxplot of diamond prices within clarity groupings\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(clarity, log(price), geom = \"boxplot\", data = diamonds)\n```\nWhy does price decrease as the quality of the diamonds increases?\n\n## Another Boxplot\n\nSide by side boxplot of log prices within clarity groupings with jittered values overlay\n\n```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}\nqplot(clarity, log(price), geom = \"boxplot\", data = diamonds, \n\tmain = \"Boxplots of log Diamond Prices Grouped by Clarity\") +\n\tgeom_jitter(alpha = I(.025))\n```\nThere are two groups of prices ... maybe related to size?\n\n## Another Boxplot\n\nSide by side boxplot of log prices within clarity groupings \n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(clarity, log(price)/carat, geom = \"boxplot\", data = diamonds)\n```\n\n\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\n1. Make side by side boxplots of tipping rate for males and females\n2. Overlay jittered points for observed values onto this boxplot\n\n## Bar Plots\n\nTo investigate bar plots we will switch over to the Titanic data set:\n\n```{r}\ntitanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)\n```\n\nData includes passenger characteristics and survival outcomes for those aboard the RMS Titanic's ill fated maiden voyage\n\n## Basic Bar Plot\n\nBasic bar plot of survival outcomes\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(Survived, geom = \"bar\", data = titanic, weight = Freq)\n```\n\n## Another Bar Plot\n\nBar plot faceted by gender and class\n\n```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}\nqplot(Survived, geom = \"bar\", data = titanic, weight = Freq, \n      facets = Sex~Class)\n```\n\n## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}\n\n1. Use the tips data to make a barplot for counts of smoking and non smoking customers\n2. Facet using day of week and time of day to view how smoking status changes for different meal times\n",
